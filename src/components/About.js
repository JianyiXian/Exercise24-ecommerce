            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p style={{ color: '#919497' }}>Zooby Promotional was founded by Brett Kershaw in 2006 as a promotional products
                supplier and custom
                importer. Through word of mouth we quickly grew to earn such national clients as PETCO, Microsoft, Lincoln
                Property Company, Fairmont Raffles Hotels International and Comerica. <br />

                Zooby Promotional has worked with clients in 40 US States and three countries.<br />

                While always striving to service our national customers, we've never lost the desire to help our local
                community. Zooby Promotional has helped raise funds for charities, schools and Universities. These Include:
                Lakewood Elementary, Episcopal School of Dallas, TCU and KERA.<br />

                We also help small local businesses achieve their goals, such as Barley House, Kinetrol, Terilli's and CIC
                Coatings.<br />

                Brett Kershaw received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1990 from SMU in Dallas, TX, with a Major in

                series "Pony Excess"(Directed by Thaddues D. Matula).<br />
